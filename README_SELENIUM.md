**Page Object Model (POM):** Page Object Model is a design pattern to create Object Repository for Web UI elemenys. Under this model, for each web page in the application there should be corresponding page class. This Page Class will find the WebElements of that web page and also contains Page methods which perdorm operations on those WebElements.

**Page Factory:** Page factory is an inbuilt Page Object Model concept for Selenium WebDriver but it is very optimized. We follow the concept separation of Page Object Repository and Test Methods. Additionally, with the help of PageFactory class, we use annotations @FindBy to find WebElement.
